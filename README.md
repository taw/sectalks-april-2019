* RSA Signatures v1 - Modern Crypto - 30
* Codage Hexadecimal - Classical Crypto - 35
* from_past_import_flag - Reverse Engineering - 40
* RSA Signatures v2 - Modern Crypto - 45
* Chifferment par Substitution - Classical Crypto - 50

Hints:

* EBCDIC: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC
* CSS: No Javascript was harmed in the making of this challenge.
* CTR: Hint: https://xkcd.com/221/
* sayflag: Hint: Hint: MP3 compression works like JPG, but block artifacts would be fatal, so compressed blocks overlap a bit. To avoid special treatment for the last block, encoders add some silence at the end of the file (also sometimes at the start), so that part usually has very low entropy. No ID3 here.
* Rust: Two versions of same challenge.
* RSA Signatures: Server at mtg.wtf:9001 Hint: RSA Signatures v2 challenge fixes some exploits. Comparing their files could be helpful.
* Codage Hexadecimal: Hex encoding with digits mixed up. All punctuation left as it is.
* from_past_import_flag: It won't get fooled by just changing your laptop clock. Two versions of same challenge.
* RSA Signatures v2: Server at mtg.wtf:9002 Some exploits got fixed, but it's RSA, so plenty of other exploits left.
* Chifferment par Substitution: Hint: Text is only lowercase characters (including accented), numbers, spaces, and newlines.
